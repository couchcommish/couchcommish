    <p class="spaced info-desktop">Christian Novarro | Dec 1, 2022 • 4 min </p>

    <p class="spaced">Following each season, Major League Baseball hosts a conference in December called the Winter Meetings. It’s a four-day event where all members of the baseball industry from team executives, to agents, to media members converge to discuss all things baseball. In particular, it’s a place where flashy offseason deals come to fruition. From Monday through Wednesday, team executives schedule meetings with other organizations and agents to conduct business. This year, organizations will be lining up to speak with the Los Angeles Angels about their hitting and pitching phenom Shohei Ohtani. While the Angels might be tempted to trade Ohtani before he becomes a free agent after the 2023 season, they would be wise not to move him just yet.</p>

<p class="spaced">Ohtani, the MLB’s reigning MVP, recently stated that he had a “rather negative impression of this [Angels] season”. Despite having two of the best players in baseball - Ohtani and four-time MVP Mike Trout - the Angels finished the 2022 season with a 73-89 record and 33 games out of first place in the American League West Division. With an unhappy superstar on the brink of free agency, it would make sense for the Angels to float Ohtani’s name. But it would be unwise to trade him. Instead, the Angels should get an idea of what certain teams may be willing to trade for him and then wait until the mid-season trade deadline.</p>

<p class="spaced">Shohei Ohtani is the most coveted player in baseball. He led the league in Wins Above Replacement (a metric that measures player value) in 2021 and finished second this past season. He pitches and hits at an elite level comparable to the likes of All Star Third Baseman Austin Riley and three-time CY Young Award winner Max Scherzer:</p>

<p><strong>Hitting Stats:</strong></p>
<p>2022 Shohei Ohtani: .273 AVG/ 34 HR/ 93 RBI/ .356 OBP/ 875 OPS</p>
<p class="strong">2022 Austin Riley: .273 AVG/ 38 HR/ 95 RBI/ .349 OBP/ 878 OPS</p>

<p><strong>Pitching Stats:</strong></p>
<p>2022 Shohei Ohtani: 2.33 ERA/ 11.9 K/9/ 1.01 WHIP</p>
<p class="spaced">2021 Max Scherzer Stats: 2.46 ERA/ 11.8 K/9/ .864 WHIP</p>

<p class="spaced">Austin Riley signed a 10 year, $212 million deal back in August and Max Scherzer inked a three year, $133 million deal following the 2021 season (his average annual salary of $43.333 million is the highest in baseball).  Combine those two players and you get Shohei Ohtani. Combine those two salaries ($64.5 million), and Ohtani would be paid more than the Oakland Athletics entire 2022 MLB payroll ($61 million). </p>

<p class="spaced">With a player of this value, the Angels would need top young talent as a return in any deal that they make. But the suitors may be limited to big-market teams like the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers, who have the financial resources to keep Ohtani long-term. And of the big-market teams (teams with top-10 payrolls in 2022), only one has a top-10 farm system as well according to MLB.com: The Dodgers.  A trade to the Angels cross-town rival seems very unlikely. </p>

<p class="spaced">Therefore, Ohtani will be treated as a one-year rental by most teams. If that is the case, it would make more sense to wait to move Ohtani at next year's mid-season trade deadline. With the MLB’s recent playoff expansion, there will be an abundance of mid-season buyers looking to improve their roster; and those teams in the playoff hunt will be more willing to meet Ohtani’s steep price-tag then in the hope of a championship. </p>

<p class="spaced">For the Angels, with two all-time great talents in Ohtani and Trout still on the roster it is not crazy to think they can compete themselves in 2023. The Angels were one of the best teams in baseball to start the season in 2022 - They had a 27-17 record before going on a 14-game losing streak. They have played good baseball in the past and if they can do well, who knows, maybe Ohtani would be open to staying long-term.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">There has never been a player of Ohtani’s talent in such a murky situation heading into the MLB’s Winter Meetings. As a result, all eyes will be on the Angels and their two-way superstar in December.</p>
