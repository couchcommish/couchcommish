            <p class="spaced">For the last two MLB offseasons, David Stearns, the current president of baseball operations for the Milwaukee Brewers, has been linked to the New York Mets. Will David Stearns finally join the Mets front office now that the team’s current team president, Sandy Alderson, is stepping down? Probably not.</p>

<p class="spaced">After leading the Brewers to a 96-win season in only his third year as GM, NY Native Stearns, 37, has led his team to four consecutive postseason berths with a payroll half the size of New York’s (the Mets have zero playoff appearances in that span). As of September 22nd, the Brewers are two and a half games behind the Philadelphia Phillies for the last NL Wild Card spot to make it a fifth consecutive season. For the third straight year, the Mets will need the Brewers permission to interview Stearns… unless the Brewers make the World Series. The Brewers have a vesting option on Stearns contract which states if the Brewers make the World Series under his tenure, he can become a free agent at the end of this season. If not, he will be under contract through 2023.</p>

<p class="spaced">There are four different types of contract options in the MLB - Team, Player, Mutual, and Vesting - with each deciding whether the last year of a player’s contract will be exercised or not. Club options grant the team the right to implement the player’s final year, while a player option gives the player the power to decide. For a mutual option, both the club and player must agree to exercise the option. Conversely, vesting options become guaranteed if the player reaches certain playing time or performance-based incentive thresholds. Vesting options are extremely uncommon. Of the 60+ MLB options that may be exercised at the end of this season, Carlos Carrasco (of the New York Mets coincidentally) is the only player who has a vested option, and of the 50 options that may be exercised after next season, only two are vested. Last year there were none.</p>

<p class="spaced">While already a rare practice in baseball, what makes the vesting option in the case of David Stearns’ contract even more unique is that he is not a player. Yet, he is being incentivized for on-field production. Better yet, where most vesting options are exercised for meeting specific performance-based thresholds, Stearns’ option is exercised if he DOES NOT reach a certain milestone.</p>

<p class="spaced">There are a few reasons why the Brewers and Stearns may have opted to structure the contract this way. From Stearns perspective, it gives him an additional year of job security. Making a World Series is not easy, and it is made harder for an organization like the Brewers that does not have the same budget as bigger market organizations. The vesting option gives Stearns an extra year of job security as well as an opportunity at a raise one year sooner (with the Brewers or another organization) if the Brewers were to make a World Series appearance. On the flip side, the Brewers have an additional year with Stearns before a richer team, like the Mets, can lure him away with more money.</p>

<p class="spaced">The Mets have tried to poach Stearns from the Brewers for the past two seasons. Back in 2020, he was heavily linked to the Mets GM opening but the Brewers refused to let Stearns interview for the role. The man the Mets hired instead was fired after about a month on the job when news broke that he had sexually harassed a reporter four years prior. His replacement was then let go in September of that same season after being arrested and charged with driving under the influence. When the Mets were in search of a new GM again during that offseason, David Stearns was once again heavily linked to the job and, again, the Brewers declined to allow Stearns to meet with the Mets.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">With the Mets now in search of Sandy Alderson’s successor, David Stearns name will surely come up again. Though not impossible, a World Series appearance for Milwaukee is very unlikely. The Brewers only have a 20% chance of making the postseason. And as it stands now, they would then need to get past their division rivals (St. Louis Cardinals), and, ironically, the Mets to even have a chance of winning an NL pennant. Barring a miracle which includes being upset by the Brewers themselves, the Mets will most likely have to wait until 2024 to get their guy.</p>
