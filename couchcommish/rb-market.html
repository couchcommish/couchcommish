            <p class="spaced info-desktop">Christian Novarro | Apr 19, 2023 • 5 min </p>

           <p class="spaced">Star running back Christian McCaffrey signed a record-breaking contract back in 2020 with the Carolina Panthers which included $38 million dollars guaranteed over the first three years of the contract. Since then, however, the value of the NFL running back has declined drastically. This trend is sure to affect two star running backs, Saquon Barkley of the New York Giants and Josh Jacobs of the Las Vegas Raiders, who are looking to get paid big dollars.</p>

<p class="spaced">There are a few factors that explain the massive drop-off in the running back market. For starters, running backs get hit a lot and, in turn, get injured a lot. Running backs have the shortest life span (the average career is 2.57 years long) and one of the highest injury rates of all NFL positions.  Since signing his massive deal, for example, Christian McCaffrey has missed 22 of a potential 49 games (45% total). In addition, teams have been able to find cheap, productive backs in the draft. Five rookie running backs, Kenneth Walker (second round), Brian Robinson (third round), Dameon Pierce (fourth round), Tyler Allgeier (fifth round), and Isiah Pacheco (seventh round) led their respective teams in rushing in 2022 with around 800 rushing yards or more. On top of leading the Kansas City Chiefs in rushing with 830 yards, Isiah Pacheco was an integral part of the Chiefs Super Bowl victory with 76 yards and a touchdown. Pacheco had a cap hit of $724,777 dollars in 2022. From an organizational standpoint, it does not make sense to give running backs with a high risk of injury big extensions when teams can alternatively get quality production for a tenth of the cost.</p>

<p class="spaced">The running back market’s drastic decline was on full display this offseason. The 2023 free agency featured a relatively strong running back class that featured highly productive players such as Miles Sanders and Jamaal Williams. However, they each took contracts that were not in line with deals for comparable players in years past. Miles Sanders, for instance, had a 2022 season that was comparable to some of the league’s top backs during their contract years. Yet, his contract was nowhere close to those players. Provided below, is the contract year statistics of three players: Miles Sanders, Aaron Jones, and Nick Chubb.</p>

<p><strong>Miles Sanders:</strong> 1269 rushing yards, 4.9 yards per carry, 11 TD, 1347 scrimmage yards</p>
<p><strong>Joe Mixon 2019:</strong> 1137 rushing yards, 4.1 yards per carry, 8 TD 1424 scrimmage yards</p>
<p class="spaced"><strong>Nick Chubb 2020:</strong> 1067 rushing yards, 5.6 yards per carry, 12 TD, 1217 scrimmage yards</p>

<p class="spaced">Both Joe Mixon and Nick Chubb received long-term extensions that pay them an average of $12 million a year. Meanwhile, Miles Sanders signed a contract with the Carolina Panthers that pays him an average salary of $6.35 million and a total of $13.2 million over the first two years of the deal. (The Panthers do not owe any guaranteed money to Sanders after the second year of the contract and can easily cut ties with him after the 2024 NFL season).</p>

<p class="spaced">Comparatively, Arizona Cardinals running back, James Connor, received $13.5 million guaranteed over 2 years last offseason ($300K more than Sanders) even though Sanders had over 200 more yards from scrimmage and averaged a whopping 1.2 more yards per carry.  James Connor’s numbers were more comparable to running back Jamaal Williams who recently signed with the New Orleans Saints. Yet, Jamaal only received $8.15 million guaranteed over two years - $4.35 Million less than Connors.</p>

<p><strong>Jamaal Williams:</strong> 1139 Scrimmage Yards, 17 TD, and 4.1 Rushing Yards/Attempt</p>
<p class="spaced"><strong>James Connor 2021:</strong> 1127 Scrimmage Yards, 18 TD, and 3.7 Rushing Yards/Attempt</p>

<p class="spaced">Two of the NFL’s top running backs, Saquon Barkley and Josh Jacobs, were also set to hit the open market this offseason with the hopes of getting a long-term deal. However, they were both given the franchise tag by their respective teams. As a result, Jacobs and Barkley will be paid $10.091 million in 2023… that is if the two running backs decide to accept. Saquon Barkley, reportedly, does not plan to sign his franchise tag as he seeks a long-term extension from the Giants – and Josh Jacobs should do the same.</p>

<p class="spaced">After a couple injury-riddled seasons, Saquon Barkley reminded everyone why he was the second overall pick back in 2018. Saquon Barkey averaged 4.4 yards per carry and had 1,312 rushing yards with 10 touchdowns in 2022. Josh Jacobs was even more impressive in 2022. He averaged 4.9 yards per carry, led the league in rushing with 1,653 yards, and he had 12 touchdowns to go along with it. Jacobs and Barkley will not get a McCaffrey-like deal for the reasons described earlier, but they do deserve to get paid like the other elite running backs in the NFL and the time to strike is now.</p>

<p class="spaced">If Barkley and Jacobs wait, they are adding another year of wear and tear on the body and risk suffering a major injury before they get paid. Saquon Barkley has already suffered a torn ACL and another serious injury would kill his chances of a lucrative deal. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that either player will hit the open market after the 2023 season. Although both players were franchise tagged this offseason, the Giants and Raiders can franchise tag both players again for the 2024 season. If a team applies the franchise tag to a player in back-to-back years, they must pay them 120% of their salary from the year before. If either Jacobs or Barkley were given the franchise tag for a second-consecutive season they would be paid around $12.1 million. For the Giants and Raiders, this is still a reasonable salary in comparison to other high-end backs. Derrick Henry, Dalvin Cook, Nick Chubb, and Joe Mixon’s 2023 salary cap hit, for example, would be greater than Jacobs and Barkley’s $12.1 million cap hit in 2024 on a second-consecutive franchise tag - the players 2023 team cap hits are $16.367 million, $14.101 million, $14.85 million, and $12.761 million respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Ultimately, it makes sense for the Giants and Raiders to refrain from signing their star backs to long-term contracts. They have Barkley and Jacobs on their roster at reasonable prices without the risks that come along with a longer deal. And, if both continue to play at an elite level, they can retain them for another season at another manageable salary. But it also makes sense for Barkley and Jacobs to not play without an extension. They were arguably the most valuable players to their teams in 2022. Despite the risk of injury and the ability for teams to find cheaper talent elsewhere, not many players can replicate the impact that Barkley and Jacobs bring. They absolutely should get paid, however, given the state of the running back position, it is unlikely they will get the deals they deserve.</p>
