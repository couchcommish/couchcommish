           <p class="spaced">The Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL) had a 3-3-1 record (three wins, three losses, and one tie) when they made the odd announcement that Sam Ehlinger would start in place of Matt Ryan for the rest of the year. Matt Ryan is a former NFL MVP on the back end of a large contract he signed back when he was the quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons. Matt Ryan is no longer the MVP-caliber player he once was, but to be benched for the remainder of the season so early on is unprecedented. When looking at Ryan’s contract however, it was clear that the benching had more to do with saving money than the quarterback’s on-field production. The same is true of another superstar QB Derek Carr who was recently benched by the Las Vegas Raiders.</p>

<p class="spaced">In the case of Ryan, it has become clear that he most likely will not be on the Colts roster next season. If the Colts cut Matt Ryan after this year, he will still be owed his 2023 base salary of $12 Million; but the quarterback also has an injury clause that would owe him an additional $17.205 million ($10 million 2023 roster bonus and additional $7.205 million 2023 salary that becomes fully guaranteed if an injury prevents him from passing a physical). At the time of Matt Ryan’s benching, he was dealing with a grade two shoulder sprain.</p>

<p class="spaced">Much like Matt Ryan, Derek Carr also has an injury clause which will cost his team a ton of money if he cannot pass a physical. Carr agreed to a three-year, $121.5 million extension with the Raiders before this season. None of Carr’s salary beyond this year, however, is guaranteed. So, Carr will be owed no additional money if the Raiders cut him after this season… unless he is injured. If Derek Carr were to get hurt and could not pass a physical, the Raiders will owe him an additional $40.4 million ($32.9 million 2023 base salary and $7.5 million from his 2024 base salary).</p>

<p class="spaced">Other high-profile quarterbacks with expensive, long-term contracts have injury clauses similar to those highlighted above. Arizona Cardinals young phenom, Kyler Murray, recently signed a five-year $230 million dollar contract with $103.3 million guaranteed with multiple injury clauses. If Murray cannot pass a physical by the 5th day of the 2024 season, his 2025 season base salary and roster bonus (equaling $29.9 million) become fully guaranteed. Similarly, if Murray cannot pass a physical by the 5th day of the 2025 season, his 2026 season base salary and roster bonus (equaling $39.835 million) become fully guaranteed. Kyler Murray has been out with a torn ACL injury that he suffered in the Cardinals’ week 14 loss to the New England Patriots. He will most likely miss a significant portion of the 2023 season as well.</p>

<p class="spaced">The Green Bay Packers four-time MVP quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, has a $47 million injury clause that becomes fully guaranteed if he cannot pass a physical after the end of the 2023 season. If this injury clause were instead for this year, Aaron Rodgers might have joined Derek Carr and Matt Ryan on the bench. The Packers and Aaron Rodgers struggled to start this season and entered week 13 with a 4-8 record and a 1% chance of making the playoffs. Aaron Rodgers is 39 years old with a former first-round draft pick, Jordan Love, as his backup. Furthermore, he has been dealing with an avulsion fracture in his right thumb all year. With the playoffs almost certainly out of reach, it would have made sense for the Packer to bench Rodgers after week 12 and see what they had in backup Jordan Love the rest of the way. With no worry of an injury forcing the Packers to pay a hurt Aaron Rodgers $47 million, the team won four of their last five and missed the playoffs by one game.</p>

<p class="spaced">It is understandable why players like Matt Ryan, Derek Carr, and others would want injury clauses. The NFL is one of the few sports in which contracts are not fully guaranteed. If Derek Carr were in the MLB and he had the same contract (three-year, $121.5 million), he would receive all $121.5 million whether he was cut or not. You are not guaranteed to receive all the money on your contract in the NFL – in most cases. Therefore, injury clauses can give players insurance if they are cut by their teams and then cannot join another team due to injury. The clauses ensure that a player will not be cut and lose out on millions of dollars solely because they were hurt on the job.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">It is not often that a player’s contract structure will play a role in their playing time, but, as demonstrated in the Derek Carr and Matt Ryan situations, it does happen. It will be interesting to see if these injury clauses are present in long-term quarterback deals negotiated in the future.</p>
