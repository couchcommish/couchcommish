        <h1>New York Mets: Time to Stop Believin’</h1>
        <p class="spaced">Brandon Novarro | May 10, 2023 • 4 min</p>
        
        <p class="spaced">We are just 36 games into the 2023 season, and the New York Mets, currently sitting at a disappointing 17-19, are causing some brows to furrow. The Mets have suffered losses in 12 of their last 15 games, squaring off against bottom-feeders like the Tigers, Rockies, Reds, and Nationals. With a record $358M estimated 2023 payroll— which had significantly boosted the Mets' World Series odds— their sluggish start is particularly alarming, especially coming off a 101-win season. While it could just be a rough start for the October hopefuls, I argue that the future might be more challenging than some imagine.</p>

        <p class="spaced">Firstly, let's examine the Mets' early-season performance. Their offense has been surprisingly dull. In an era of baseball where the long ball dominates, the Mets have an old-school approach, scoring runs by getting on base and driving in consistent hits. However, they're struggling in these areas. The Mets, hitting 40 HRs (T-15th overall), are middling in power. Yet, they haven't compensated for this with contact or getting on base, hitting only .236 as a team (T-21st overall) with a .324 OBP (14th overall).</p>

        <p class="spaced">Their pitching, where they've invested over $100 million in the starting rotation, has been worse, ranking 23rd in ERA (4.82) and allowing 52 home runs this season.</p>

        <p class="spaced">So, with a team that, on paper, is relatively similar to last year’s, what could be the problem? There have been some injuries to players like Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, and Carlos Carrasco. But could that really account for the widespread poor performances? I believe the primary issue is age.</p>

        <p class="spaced">Yet again this season, the Mets have the oldest average-aged team in the MLB. These older players, despite their experience, are only getting older. Take Max Scherzer's disappointing start, for example, a 5.56 ERA, six home runs allowed, and only 20 strikeouts in 5 starts. Scherzer's injury-plagued tenure and declining production might surprise some, but at 38 years old, it's a reminder that no one can outpace Father Time, even superstars like Mad Max.</p>

        <p class="spaced">GM Billy Eppler appears to have overlooked the age factor, signing veterans like Scherzer (38), Verlander (40), Starling Marte (34), Mark Canha (34), Eduardo Escobar (34), José Quintana (34), Adam Ottavino (38), and David Robertson (38). Most of these moves haven't panned out as hoped, with many players underperforming or succumbing to injuries. While we hope these players can overcome their injuries and contribute to a World Series push, there's no guarantee an aging roster won’t continue to exhibit signs of age.</p>

        <p class="spaced">Despite the slow and arguably embarrassing start, there are glimmers of hope. The Mets have finally promoted hopeful franchise cornerstones C Francisco Alvarez and 3B Brett Baty, both of whom are starting to find their rhythm. Baty is hitting .294 in his last 15 games, and Alvarez recently celebrated his first career 2-HR game. In Triple-A, Mark Vientos and Ronny Mauricio are mashing, hitting .339 with 11 HRs and 29 RBIs and .336 with 6 HRs and 16 RBIs, respectively,  suggesting we might see them in Mets uniforms sooner than later, as hinted by Eppler.</p>

        <p class="spaced">However, the Mets, and particularly Billy Epler, face significant decisions as the trade deadline nears. The Mets need to find their identity. Are they the juggernaut they were touted to be in the offseason? If so, they must make major moves at the deadline, potentially adding a major power-bat to cement a roster that, just months ago, looked a move or two away from being a legitimate World Series contender. </p>

        <p class="spaced">If, however, the Mets continue to flounder, descending further in the standings, it might be an easier decision to offload their aging veterans and bolster a top-heavy farm system that's severely lacking in depth. While such a move would be disappointing, given the team's enormous payroll and lofty pre-season expectations, it might ultimately prove beneficial. </p>

        <p class="spaced">Arguably, the worst-case scenario is if the Mets hover around .500. This would prove the team has glaring holes throughout the roster, potentially more than a few moves away from contending. Given Steve Cohen's first 3-5 year WS hopes, and the Mets' previous deadline flop, Billy Epler might feel pressured to trade away one of the Mets' elite prospects for a vet, further draining an already thin farm system for a possibly fruitless postseason run. </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">While Steve Cohen’s deep pockets will allow the Mets to stay competitive each year, the organization's aging roster and weak farm system can't be ignored. Unless this team starts playing as we all hoped, the future might look rather bleak. However, in the spirit of optimism, it’s early. let's remember that baseball is a sport full of surprises. Ya gotta believe. The Mets may have some major decisions to make, but we can only wait and see what the rest of the season brings. </p>
