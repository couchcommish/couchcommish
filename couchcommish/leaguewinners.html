        <h2>Early Rounds (Rounds 1-2)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">All of these players are consistently getting picked in or around the 2nd round in drafts, regardless of format. </p>

        <h2>Nick Chubb (RB, Browns)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">Nick Chubb has proven time and again that he's a fantasy football staple. Year after year, he not only meets expectations but often surpasses them. PFF consistently ranks him among the elite running backs, a testament to his sheer talent and game-changing abilities. This season looks even more promising for Chubb owners. With the evolving chemistry in year 2 between Watson and the receiving corps, especially with the exciting addition of Elijah Moore, the offense is poised for more firepower. And let's not forget the departure of Kareem Hunt. This not only opens up the field for more pass-catching opportunities for Chubb but also solidifies his role as the undisputed bell-cow of the offense. I'm placing my bets on Chubb to finish in the RB1 spot this year.</p>

        <h2>Tony Pollard (RB, Cowboys)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">Now, let’s talk about another potential goldmine: a player who, much like Chubb, has the potential to finish as RB1 yet is still available in the 2nd round of drafts. With the Cowboys making the decision to part ways with Ezekiel Elliott, the door has swung wide open for Tony Pollard to step up as the lead back. Every time he's been handed the ball, Pollard has showcased his undeniable talent. He's positioned within one of the NFL's most explosive offenses, so expect a surge in touchdown numbers. With Zeke out of the picture and Duece Vaughn, standing at just 5’5”, unlikely to dominate in goal-line scenarios, Pollard's chances to shine have never looked brighter.</p>

        <h2>Garrett Wilson (WR, Jets)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">The Reigning OROY had over 1,100 yards with arguably the worst QB play in all of the NFL. The guy is straight-up talented and will make plays after the catch regardless of if his QB had trouble getting him the ball. Wilson will go from catching passes from Zach Wilson, Joe Flacco, and Mike White to one of the most talented passers in NFL history Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers loves to lock in one top receiver, as we have seen in years past with Davante Adams and Jordy Nelson. We have already seen some chemistry start to form in camp, with Wilson getting Adams comparisons. I’m buying the hype. I’m all in. Wilson has legit potential to finish as the overall WR1. </p>

        <h2 class="spaced">Middle Rounds (Rounds 3-6)</h2>

        <h2>Chris Olave (WR, Saints)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">If you've already taken a glance at my take on Garrett Wilson, then it's time to spotlight another OSU sensation: Chris Olave. Some pundits believed Olave was even more skilled than Wilson during their collegiate days. Despite being held back by underwhelming quarterback play last year, Olave still managed to put up impressive numbers. Now, with Derek Carr orchestrating the offense, the prospects are even brighter. Carr's proficiency in launching deep balls plays directly to Olave's strengths. Expect Olave to outperform his current ADP, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see him climb into the top-10, or dare I say, the top-5 wide receivers by season's end.</p>

        <h2>Darren Waller (TE, Giants)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">It baffles me to see Darren Waller being drafted behind the likes of Kittle, Pitts, Goedert, and others. It's as if many have forgotten just how electrifying a pass-catching TE Waller truly is. The Giants, well aware of their somewhat uninspiring receiving group, made a decisive move to bring Waller into the fold. While Daniel Jones might not be the most exhilarating quarterback on the gridiron, the question remains: who else is in a prime position to be his go-to target? Training camp buzz corroborates this sentiment, with reports consistently highlighting how frequently Jones seeks out Waller. My projection? Waller nabs the TE2 spot right behind Kelce by season’s end. At his current ADP, he's a potential league-winning pick.</p>

        <h2>Cam Akers (RB, Rams)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">If both Stafford and Kupp remain injury-free, Akers is poised to become the bell cow in one of the NFL's premier offenses. Are Kyren Williams or Zach Evans truly threats to his primary role? All signs point to Akers claiming that coveted RB1 spot. Let’s not forget his impressive performance at the tail-end of last season, which only reinforced his status as an elite fantasy RB. Granted, there's no denying that Akers, and the Rams' offense, at large, carry a considerable injury risk. But when you consider his current ADP, the potential for league-winning returns far outweighs any apprehensions about that risk.</p>

        <h2>Khalil Herbert (RB, Browns)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">Initially, my gaze was set on other backs in this lineup, particularly D’Onta Foreman and Roschon Johnson, as potential deep-round sleepers. But overlooking Herbert's consistent productivity was an oversight on my part. Perhaps his recent preseason performance served as a much-needed reminder. There’s an undeniable allure to Herbert’s potential. Plus, with the team likely to elevate their offensive play in Fields' third year and the added firepower of DJ Moore, Herbert's prospects are looking even brighter.</p>

        <h2>Amari Cooper (WR, Browns)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">Amari Cooper, much like Chubb, epitomizes reliability. While he might not garner as much buzz as some of the newer, younger wide receivers emerging in the game, his skills as an elite route runner affirm his position among the top WRs. The optimism for Cooper and the entire offense hinges on Watson getting more comfortable (hopefully enough so he doesn’t need a massage) in his new role. If the chemistry between Cooper and Watson truly ignites, the sky's the limit. Considering his ADP, Cooper presents a safer bet, both in terms of sheer talent and his specific team context, than many others being drafted in his vicinity. The addition of Elijah Moore should hopefully help take away attention from Cooper and improve the offense as a whole. Don't be surprised if he surpasses expectations, finishing as a top-10 WR and steering many fantasy teams to victory.</p>

        <h2 class="spaced">Later Rounds</h2>

        <h2>Anthony Richardson (QB, Colts)</h2>
        <p class="spaced>Sure, we can anticipate some teething troubles, and Richardson's passing abilities appeared somewhat underdeveloped during his preseason debut. But we can't overlook the fact that Richardson entered the NFL as one of its most athletically gifted prospects ever. From a fantasy lens, considering his ADP, he doesn’t necessarily have to excel as a top-tier passer for owners to reap benefits (cough, cough, Justin Fields). His potential in the running game is tantalizing, making him a compelling candidate to be this year’s league-winning QB. To hedge my bets, I’m all in for pairing him with a steadier, predictable quarterback – someone like Geno Smith or Kirk Cousins – just in case Richardson’s season doesn't ascend as anticipated.</p>

        <h2>Jordan Addison (WR, Vikings)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">Recent years have witnessed a surge of rookie WRs seamlessly transitioning into the NFL and emerging as pivotal fantasy assets. Among this year's deep class, I'm placing my money on Addison making the most significant impact in his debut season. In contrast to peers like Quentin Johnston and Jaxon Smith Njigba, Addison isn't engulfed in an overly saturated WR room. The Vikings exhibit a conspicuous void at the WR2 position, carving out an evident role for Addison. With Jefferson anticipated to attract the lion's share of defensive focus, the door is wide open for Addison to seize his opportunities. Bolstered by a robust offense and with Kirk Cousins at the helm, I'm confident in Addison's potential to consistently receive and capitalize on quality targets.</p>

        <h2>Tank Bigsby (RB, Jaquars)</h2>
        <p class="spaced">There’s something inherently thrilling about a player named "Tank." Hailing from Auburn as a sizable, powerhouse running back, Tank was snatched up in this year's 3rd round. Now, he's positioned just behind Travis Etienne in what's shaping up to be one of the league's most dynamic young offenses. I'm genuinely bullish on this team, and I can envision Tank capitalizing on numerous goal-line chances. This alone could cement his status as a dependable fantasy asset, even with Etienne on the field. And should Etienne face any injury setbacks? Well, all bets are off – Tank has the potential to catapult fantasy teams to championship glory.</p>

        <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
        <p class="spaced">Though each of these players possesses the potential to be genuine league-winners, I've opted to exclude them from my list. The primary reasons being their steadily rising ADPs and the presence of certain uncertainties, especially when compared to the selections I've highlighted. These guys just missed my cut. </p>

        <h2>Calvin Ridley (WR, Jaguars)</h2>
        <h2>Jahmyr Gibbs (RB, Lions)</h2>
        <h2>Rachaad White (RB, Buccaneers)</h2>
        <h2>Sky Moore (WR, Chiefs)</h2>
        <h2>Elijah Moore (WR, Browns)</h2>
        <h2>Daniel Jones (QB, Giants)</h2>
