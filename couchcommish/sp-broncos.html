            <p class="spaced info-desktop">Christian Novarro | Feb 22, 2022 • 4 min </p>

           <p class="spaced">Last summer a group led by Rob Walton and Greg Penner spent a record $4.65 Billion of their Walmart fortune to purchase the National Football League’s (NFL) Denver Broncos. After recently landing former New Orleans Saints head coach, Sean Payton, they put the NFL on notice and showed their fans they will do whatever it takes to put out the best product on Sundays.</p>

<p class="spaced">Sean Payton’s contract with the Broncos is for five years and is “in the neighborhood of” $18 million a year. The contract makes him the second highest paid head coach in the NFL behind Bill Belichick. On their own merits, those numbers represent a huge investment in a coach. In addition to this massive contract, the Broncos also traded the Saints a 2023 first-round pick (No. 29 overall) and a 2024 second-round selection for the rights to Sean Payton and a future third-round pick from the Saints. This is only the fourth time in league history that an organization traded at least a 1st round pick to acquire an opposing coach’s rights from another franchise. The three previous trades saw Bill Parcells move from the New England Patriots to the New York Jets, Bill Belichick from the Jets to the Patriots, and Jon Gruden from the Oakland Raiders to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>

<p class="spaced">This statement move might just be the beginning for the new Broncos’ owners. With a net worth of approximately $59 Billion, Rob Walton is the richest owner in the NFL. His net worth is more than double that of any other ownership group (The Allen Family of the Seattle Seahawks is second with a net worth of around $20.3 Billion). Furthermore, half of the NFL’s owners have a net worth that is less than $5 Billion – about 12 times less than Mr. Walton.</p>

<p class="spaced">Luckily for the rest of the NFL, there are limitations on how much money a team spend on their players. The NFL has a salary cap that all 32 teams cannot go beyond. Each team will have a salary cap of $224.8 Million that they cannot surpass for 2023. There are ways that richer organizations can take advantage of the salary cap each year with a concept termed “cash over cap”. The easiest method to spend above the cap comes from the signing bonus. To give an example, if a player is given a three-year deal with a $15 Million signing bonus, only $5 Million of that bonus will apply to the salary cap in the first year of the deal. The other $10 Million will affect the cap in the remaining years of the deal ($5 Million in both the second and third years.) In this hypothetical scenario, the team spent $15 Million, but only $5 Million was accounted for on the salary cap for the upcoming season.</p>

<p class="spaced">Therefore, the Broncos can theoretically spend more than the salary cap allows in a given season. However, that money will always show up on a team’s salary cap at some point down the line and would restrict the amount a team can then spend in those later seasons. No matter how rich the Broncos may be, the NFL’s salary cap restrictions prohibit them from using their wealth to gain an unfair advantage. But the salary cap only applies to players. There are no restrictions on how much a coach can be paid. The same goes for scouts, front-office executives, and other highly coveted personnel.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">The Sean Payton hire makes it clear that the Broncos’ owners will spend whatever they can to improve their team. How they will continue to use their fortune to their advantage is unclear, but it will be an interesting situation to monitor in the years to come.</p>
