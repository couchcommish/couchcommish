    <h1 class="info-desktop">NFL Futures: Awards Predictions and Top Value Picks</h1>
    <p class="spaced info-desktop">Brandon Novarro | May 11, 2023 • 5 min</p>

        <p class="spaced"><i>*Odds provided are consensus odds via the Action Network</i></p>
        
        <h2>MVP</h2>
        <h3>Prediction: Jalen Hurts +1000</h3>
        <p class="spaced">Were it not for injuries causing him to miss a handful of games towards the end of the regular season, Jalen Hurts could have been the 2022 MVP, instead of Patrick Mahomes. Hurts has improved consistently each year, and if he can lead the Eagles to a top seed while maintaining his impressive dual-threat stats, he could again be a strong MVP contender. Besides the 49ers, the Eagles face comparatively little competition for a top record in the NFC.</p>
        <h3>Value Pick: Aaron Rodgers +1600</h3>
        <p class="spaced">Despite having the 7th best odds to win the award, I believe Aaron Rodgers presents solid value. Even after a down year, Rodgers is just a year removed from securing back-to-back MVPs. Now playing with a top-5 NFL defense and an exciting offensive lineup including Garrett Wilson, Allen Lazard, Mecole Hardman, and Breece Hall, Rodgers could surprise many. If his disappointing season was indeed due to a thumb injury, this Rodgers-Jets partnership could prove as explosive as suggested.</p>

        <h2>DPOY</h2>
        <h3>Prediction: Micah Parsons +700</h3>
        <p class="spaced">With 13 and 13.5 sacks in his first two seasons, Parsons has been phenomenal. Now, transitioning permanently to DE, I expect this move to result in a league-leading sack campaign, potentially earning Parsons his first DPOY award.</p>
        <h3>Value Pick: Aidan Hutchinson +3000</h3>
        <p class="spaced">Hutchinson made a significant impact in his rookie season, becoming an immediate standout for a Detroit team in desperate need of a defensive leader. After showcasing his potential with 9.5 sacks in his debut season, I anticipate a substantial improvement in his second year, placing him among the top contenders for DPOY.</p>

        <h2>OPOY</h2>
        <h3>Prediction and Value Pick: Bijan Robinson +4000</h3>
        <p class="spaced">No rookie has ever claimed the OPOY title, but that could change with Robinson. Pairing a once-in-a-generation RB talent like Robinson with Arthur Smith, who led the second-highest run-play team in the NFL, could result in a spectacular season. With Desmond Ridder/Taylor Heinicke under center, I expect the Falcons to lean on Robinson. Additionally, with the Falcons having the easiest SOS this season, Robinson could potentially drive Atlanta to win a weak wide-open division.</p>

        <h2>OROY</h2>
        <h3>Prediction: Bijan Robinson +300</h3>
        <p class="spaced">See the reasoning above.</p>
        <h3>Value Pick: Devon Achane +3000</h3>
        <p class="spaced">Running a 4.33 40, Achane seems the perfect fit for Mike McDaniels' high-speed offensive system. Despite sharing the backfield with Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jr., the RB1 spot seems within Achane's reach. With his game-breaking speed and pass-catching ability, an unleashed Achane in this talented offense could produce impressive numbers in his rookie season.</p>

        <h2>DROY</h2>
        <h3>Prediction: Will Anderson +350</h3>
        <p class="spaced">Call me predictable, but I'm siding with the odds-on favorite and the first defensive player selected in the draft, Will Anderson. Despite stiff competition from Jalen Carter, Anderson is arguably the finest prospect in the entire 2023 draft. As the central figure of the Texans defense and under the guidance of promising first-year defensive HC DeMeco Ryans, Anderson stands a good chance of putting up DROY-worthy sack numbers, considering his impressive tally of 34.5 over three years at Alabama.</p>
        <h3>Value Pick: Emmanuel Forbes +1600</h3>
        <p class="spaced">This cornerback class is rich in talent, and I anticipate several players making a big splash in their rookie season. For a value pick for DROY, I'm leaning towards Forbes. Standing at 6’1” with a 4.35 speed, Forbes brings a lot to the table. Given his record of 14 interceptions in 3 years at Mississippi State, he's one to watch in the Commanders defense.</p>

        <h2>CPOY</h2>
        <h3>Prediction: Damar Hamlin -650</h3>
        <p class="spaced">No player has faced more adversity in the past year than Hamlin. As the odds suggest, Hamlin is a firm favorite for the award. If he makes a successful comeback and contributes to a Bills playoff run, it's hard to see past Hamlin as a top pick for comeback player of the year.</p>
        <h3>Value Pick: Sam Darnold +5000</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">A promising QB prospect initially drafted by the Jets, Darnold has bounced around the league and now has a shot at revealing his true potential (sound familiar?). If you've written off Sam Darnold, think again. The former #3 overall pick now finds himself in a competitive, injury-hit QB room in San Francisco. Should Darnold secure the starting spot, he'll be at the helm of one of the most QB-friendly offenses in the league, complete with weapons such as Deebo Samuel, George Kittle, Brandon Aiyuk, and Christian McCaffrey. Bold prediction: The 49ers make it back to the NFC championship, but this time with Darnold under center.</p>
