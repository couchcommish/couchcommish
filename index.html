        <h2 class="spaced">About Couch Commish</h2>
        <p class="spaced">Welcome to Couch Commish, your friendly neighborhood sports blog for average joes who think they can easily be the general manager of their local pro sports team. My name is Brandon Novarro, a University of Michigan student, and your self-appointed Commissioner of Couch Commish. As the founder of this blog, my devotion to the NY Jets, Mets, and Knicks has led me down a path of relentless optimism and frequent heartbreak, and I'm thrilled to share this journey with you.</p>

        <p class="spaced">Born out of a deep passion for sports, Couch Commish started as a fun project to build and publish a landing page for me, my friends and my family to express our thoughts, analysis, and often humorous rants and commentary on our beloved teams. But as the ball starts rolling, I realize that this platform could be more than just a pet project. It could be a community for sports fans of all teams, all games, and all levels of fanaticism.</p>

        <p class="spaced">At Couch Commish, we dive into everything from play-by-play analysis, team breakdowns, trades, drafts, and of course, seasoned with a good dose of self-deprecating humor. As we grow, I look forward to welcoming more sports enthusiasts into our team of writers, expanding our coverage across a broad range of sports and leagues, and making this blog a comprehensive hub for all things sports.</p>

        <p class="spaced">But most importantly, I see Couch Commish as a space where fans can engage in passionate discussions, share their perspectives, and feel part of a vibrant sports community. Whether you're a fellow Jets, Mets, and Knicks sympathizer, a die-hard sports fanatic, or just someone who enjoys a good sports debate, this is the place for you.</p>

        <p class="spaced">So, join me in the journey. Grab your favorite game-day snack, pull up a seat on the couch, and let's celebrate the joy, heartbreak, and sheer unpredictability of sports. Bring your love for the game, your opinions (no matter how controversial), and your sense of humor. The more the merrier!</p>

        <p class="spaced">To good games, better debates, and the best fans, welcome to Couch Commish.</p>
